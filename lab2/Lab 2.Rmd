```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```



## Task 1

```{R}
getwd()

```


## Task 2

```{R}
EPAGAS = read.csv("EPAGAS.csv")
head(EPAGAS)

```


## Task 3


```{R}
mpg = EPAGAS$MPG
head(mpg)
```




mpg to z

```{R}
z = (mpg - mean(mpg)) / sd(mpg)
head(z)
print(paste0("mean = ", round(mean(z), digits = 4)))
print(paste0("variance = ", var(z)))
print(paste0("standard deviation = ", sd(z)))
```



```{R}
mpg[abs(z) >= 2 & abs(z) <= 3]
```

Values of mpg that are outliers


```{R}
mpg[abs(z) > 3]
```

Plot of mpg values

```{R}
mpgcol = ifelse(abs(z) > 3, "red", 
  ifelse(abs(z) >= 2 & abs(z) <= 3, "blue", "black"))

library(lattice)
dotplot(mpg, col = mpgcol, main = "Plot of mpg values")
```

## Task 4

```{R}
boxplot(mpg, main = "MPG Boxplot", xlab = "MPG", col = "green3", border = "black", horizontal = TRUE, notch = TRUE)
```

Chebyshev's Theorem

```{R}
cheb = 2
k = 2
cheb - 1 - 1 / (k ^ 2)
cheb
```

The exact proportion of data within 2 standard deviations

```{R}
exacttwo = length(mpg[abs(z) < 2]) / length(mpg)
exacttwo
```


```{R}
exactthree = length(mpg[abs(z) < 3]) / length(mpg)
exactthree
```


Question: Does Chebyshev's theorem agree with the data?  [Yes]

Empirical Rule

```{R}
empirical = length(mpg[abs(mpg - mean(mpg)) < 2 * sd(mpg)]) / length(mpg)
empirical
```


Question: How well does it correspond? [Exactly, both are 0.96 or 96%]

Question: Is the Empirical Rule valid in this case? [Yes]

Question: Why? [Because the data set is mound shaped and approximately 90% of the data is within 2 standard deviations]

```{R}
hist(mpg, main = "Histogram", xlab = "MPG", ylab = "Frequency", col = "skyblue" )
```
